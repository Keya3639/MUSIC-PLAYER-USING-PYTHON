# Music-Player-Using-Python

The **Music Player System** is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to play, pause, stop, and manage audio files through an intuitive graphical interface. Built with Tkinter and Pygame, this tool supports playlists, volume control, track navigation, and real-time audio duration tracking.

This application is ideal for students, developers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in learning how multimedia applications work in Python.

## Overview
The Music Player uses **Tkinter** for **GUI design** and **Pygame Mixer** for handling audio playback. Users can browse songs, build playlists, control playback, and view both total duration and current progress of the track.
It also integrates **Mutagen** for accurately reading MP3 metadata and threading to ensure smooth playback without freezing the interface.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used for development.

- **Tkinter:** Provides the graphical user interface (buttons, labels, frames, listboxes).

- **ttk & ttkthemes:** Enhance the look and feel with styled widgets and themes.
  
- **Tokenizer (from Transformers):** Splits text into tokens and prepares it for model input.
  
- **Pygame (mixer):** Handles music loading and playback.
  
- **Mutagen:** Reads MP3 metadata and track duration accurately.
  
- **Threading:** Keeps UI responsive while music plays.
  
- **Pyttsx3:** Adds text-to-speech welcome audio.
  
- **OS Module:** Enables user interaction by accepting prompts and displaying generated text.
  
## Why These Tools Were Selected
- **Tkinter** is built into Python and makes GUI development simpler.
  
- **Pygame mixer** is lightweight and efficient for playing audio.

- **Mutagen** ensures precise audio duration instead of guessing.

- **Threading** prevents UI freezing during playback.

- **Python** offers clean, readable syntax for rapid development.
Together, these tools create a smooth, functional music playback experience.
## Features
- **Play / Pause / Stop controls**

- **Add songs to playlist**

- **Delete or clear playlist**

## Conclusion
The **Music Player System** showcases how Python can be used to develop real-world multimedia applications. With **Tkinter, Pygame, and Mutagen,** this project combines **GUI programming, audio handling, and user interaction** in a powerful yet simple tool. With further enhancements, it can evolve into a fully-featured media player.
